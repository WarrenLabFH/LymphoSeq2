\usage{
cloneTrack(
  sequence_matrix,
  sample_map = "none",
  productive_aa,
  label = "none",
  sequence_track = "none",
  unassigned = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence_matrix}{A sequence matrix generated from the LymphoSeq 
function seqMatrix.}

\item{label}{An optional character vector of one or more labels used to 
annotate the mapped sequences.  The order of the labels must match the order 
of the samples listed in map.}

\item{unassigned}{A Boolean value indicating whether or not to draw the lines 
of sequences not being mapped or tracked.  If TRUE then the unassigned 
sequences are drawn.  If FALSE, then the unassigned sequences are not drawn.}

\item{map}{An optional character vector of one or more sample names contained 
in the productive_aa tibble.  If the same sequence appears in multiple mapped 
samples, then it will be assigned the label of the first listed sample only.}

\item{productive.aa}{A list of data frames of productive amino acid sequences 
containing the samples to be mapped.  This parameter is only required if 
sequence mapping is performed.}

\item{track}{An optional character vector of one or more amino acid sequences 
to track.}
}
\value{
Returns a line plot showing the amino acid frequencies across 
multiple samples in the sequence matrix where each line represents one 
unique sequence.
}
\description{
Creates line plot tracking amino acid frequencies across multiple samples
}
\details{
The plot is made using the package ggplot2 and can be reformatted
using ggplot2 functions.  See examples below.
