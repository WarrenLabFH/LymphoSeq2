\usage{
alignSeq(
  study_table,
  repertoire_ids = NULL,
  sequence_list = NULL,
  edit_distance = 15,
  output = "console",
  type = "junction",
  method = "ClustalOmega",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble consisting of antigen receptor sequences 
imported by the LymphoSeq function readImmunoSeq.}

\item{sequence_list}{A character vector of one ore more amino acid or junction 
CDR3 sequences to search.}

\item{edit_distance}{An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the 
sequence must be less than or equal to.  See details below.}

\item{output}{A character vector indicating where the multiple sequence alignment should be
printed.  Options include "console" or "pdf".  If "pdf" is selected, the file is saved to
the working directory.  For "pdf" to work, Texshade must be installed.  Refer to the 
Bioconductor package msa installation instructions for more details.}

\item{type}{A character vector indicating whether "junction_aa" or "junction" sequences
should be aligned.  If "junction_aa" is specified, then run productiveSeqs first.}

\item{method}{A character vector indicating the multiple sequence alignment method to 
be used.  Refer to the Bioconductor msa package for more details.  Options include 
"ClustalW", "ClustalOmega", and "Muscle".}

\item{repertoire_id}{A character vector indicating the name of the repertoire_id in the productive
sequence list.}
}
\value{
Performs a multiple sequence alignment and prints to the console or saves a pdf to 
the working directory.
}
\description{
Perform multiple sequence alignment using one of three methods and output results to the 
console or as a pdf file.  One may perform the alignment of all amino acid or junction
sequences in a single repertoire_id.  Alternatively, one may search for a given sequence 
within a list of samples using an edit distance threshold.
}
\details{
Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences 
are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to 
transform one sequence into the other.  For example, an edit distance of 0 
means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that 
the sequences different by a single amino acid or junction.

file.path <- system.file("extdata", "IGH_sequencing", package = "LymphoSeq")

productive.nt <- productiveSeq(file.list = file.list, aggregate = "junction")
