\usage{
seqMatrix(productive_aa, sequences)
}
\arguments{
\item{productive_aa}{A tibble of productive amino acid sequences 
generated by LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the aggregate parameter 
was set to "junction_aa".}

\item{sequences}{A character vector of amino acid sequences of interest.  It 
is useful to specify the output from the LymphoSeq functions uniqueSeqs or 
topSeqs and subsetting the "junction_aa" column.  See examples below.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of unique, productive amino acid sequences as 
rows and the \% frequency it appears in each repertoire_id as columns.
}
\description{
Creates a data frame with unique, productive amino acid sequences as rows and 
repertoire_id names as headers.  Each value in the data frame represents the 
frequency that the sequence appeared in the repertoire_id.

file.path <- system.file("extdata", "TCRB_sequencing", package = "LymphoSeq")

study_table <- readImmunoSeq(path = file.path)

productive_aa <- productiveSeq(study_table = study_table, aggregate = "junction_aa")

sequence_matrix <- seqMatrix(productive_aa = productive_aa, 
   sequences = unique_seqs$junction_aa)

# It can be helpful to combine top.freq and sequence.matrix
top.freq <- topFreq(productive.aa = productive.aa, percent = 0)

sequence.matrix <- seqMatrix(productive.aa = productive.aa, sequences = top.freq$junction_aa)

top.freq.matrix <- merge(top.freq, sequence.matrix)
